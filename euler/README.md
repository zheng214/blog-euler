**69.** [Totient Maximum](https://github.com/zheng214/euler/blob/master/euler/7/index.js#L525-L566) | <br/> Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n.<br/> For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.<br/><br/> For n ≤ 10, n = 6 produces a maximum n/φ(n).<br/><br/> <strong>Question:</strong> Find the value of n ≤ 1,000,000 for which n/φ(n) is a maximum. | 510*** | 0.578ms | [:arrow_upper_right:](https://projecteuler.net/problem=69)<br/><br/>
**70.** [Totient permutation](https://github.com/zheng214/euler/blob/master/euler/7/index.js#L568-L614) |  Euler's Totient function, φ(n), is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to n which are relatively prime to n.<br/> For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.<br/> The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so φ(1)=1.<br/> Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.<br/><br/> <strong>Question:</strong> Find the value of n, 1 < n < 107, for which φ(n) is a permutation of n and the ratio n/φ(n) produces a minimum. | 831**** | 762.765ms | [:arrow_upper_right:](https://projecteuler.net/problem=70)<br/><br/>
**71.** [Ordered fractions](https://github.com/zheng214/euler/blob/master/euler/8/index.js#L2-L37) | <br/> Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers.<br/> If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.<br/><br/> If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:<br/> 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8<br/><br/> It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.<br/><br/> <strong>Question:</strong> By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000 in ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7. | 428*** | 5.353ms | [:arrow_upper_right:](https://projecteuler.net/problem=71)<br/><br/>

**73.** [Counting fractions in a range](https://github.com/zheng214/euler/blob/master/euler/8/index.js#L82-L111) | <br/> Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers.<br/> If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.<br/><br/> If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:<br/> 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8<br/><br/> It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.<br/><br/> <strong>Question:</strong> How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 12,000? | 729**** | 944.184ms | [:arrow_upper_right:](https://projecteuler.net/problem=73)<br/><br/>
**74.** [Digit factorial chains](https://github.com/zheng214/euler/blob/master/euler/8/index.js#L113-L195) | <br/> The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145:<br/> 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145<br/><br/> Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169;<br/> it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:<br/> 169 → 363601 → 1454 → 169<br/> 871 → 45361 → 871<br/> 872 → 45362 → 872<br/><br/> It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,<br/> 69 → 363600 → 1454 → 169 → 363601 (→ 1454)<br/> 78 → 45360 → 871 → 45361 (→ 871)<br/> 540 → 145 (→ 145)<br/><br/> Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.<br/><br/> <strong>Question:</strong> How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms? | 4** | 1067.985ms | [:arrow_upper_right:](https://projecteuler.net/problem=74)<br/><br/>
